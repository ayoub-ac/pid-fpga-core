This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

The full GPL-3.0 text is canonical and lives at the FSF link above. A copy is available for convenience: <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt>.

**What this means in practice**: if you use this RTL in a project, the project itself (including any FPGA bitstream produced from it) must also be released under GPL-3.0-or-later. The GPL is "viral" — your downstream users must receive the same rights you received, including the right to the complete corresponding source.

If that is fine for your project, you are good to go. No fee, no email needed.

## Commercial license (closed-source / proprietary use)

If you want to use this core in a product whose source is not GPL — for example a closed-source motor drive, a brushless / BLDC controller IC, an autopilot for drones / UAVs, an industrial PLC firmware, an SMPS / DC-DC voltage regulator with digital control, a process-control product, or any FPGA-based motion / temperature / pressure regulator — you need a commercial license.

The commercial license:

- removes the GPL viral requirement,
- grants you (and your company) the right to integrate the core into closed-source products,
- gives you a clear, written grant you can show to your customers and to a due-diligence auditor,
- includes a 1-year fix window on bugs and clarifications.

Pricing tiers and the purchase link are listed at the project page (see the URL in the README citation block). For tier inquiries, email the address listed in the project page.

## Trademarks

"PID" is a generic term for the proportional-integral-derivative control law used in industrial control since at least the 1920s; no trademark claim is made on the name. References to specific control textbooks (Astrom & Hagglund, Franklin & Powell) are made for technical clarity only.

## Patents

To the best of the author's knowledge, the discrete-time positional-form PID algorithm and the standard anti-windup techniques (conditional integration / "clamp" and back-calculation per Astrom & Hagglund 1995) are not encumbered by patents in the United States or the European Union as of 2026; both are described in publicly accessible engineering literature predating the patent term. The author makes no warranty about patent freedom in other jurisdictions; if you ship hardware globally you are responsible for your own patent due diligence.
